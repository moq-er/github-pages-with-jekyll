Priya worked hard to pursue her premed dreams at Stanford, but a diagnosis of chronic Lyme disease during her sophomore year sends her back to her loving but overbearing family in New Jersey — and leaves her wondering if she’ll ever be able to return to the way things were.

    Thankfully she has her online pen pal, Brigid, and the rest of the members of ‘oof ouch my bones’, a virtual support group that meets on Discord to crack jokes and vent about their own chronic illnesses.

    When Brigid suddenly goes offline, Priya does something out of character: she steals the family car and drives to Pennsylvania to check on Brigid. Priya isn’t sure what to expect, but it isn’t the horrifying creature that’s shut in the basement.

    With Brigid nowhere to be found, Priya begins to puzzle together an impossible but obvious truth: the creature might be a weregiraffe—and the weregiraffe might be Brigid. As Brigid’s unique condition worsens, their friendship will be deepened and challenged in unexpected ways, forcing them to reckon with their own ideas of what it means to be normal.
